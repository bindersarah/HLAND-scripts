HLAND is run out of Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine. Our main objective is to conduct longitdinal observational analyses on older adults (healthy adults and adults with MCI or AD). The main data that we collect includes cognitive testing data, brain-imaging data (PET/MRI), demographic and medical history data, and data derived from blood samples.
