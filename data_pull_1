# For Mackenzie

I have a list of participant names who have completed both the 7T MRI and cognitive testing. 
I need to de-identify them by matching the names to the subject number "sub_num". 
Then, I will match the sub_num to the desired data to share with a collaborator.

## Import
  
```{r}
all_pts <- read_excel("/Volumes/shr1/Other Projects/working_files_SHB/for Mackenzie/all_participants.xlsx")
mri_pts <- read_excel("/Volumes/shr1/Other Projects/working_files_SHB/for Mackenzie/7T_participants.xlsx")
alltracers <- read.csv("/Users/ella2/Downloads/Alltracers_data (3).csv")
  ```

## Join
  
```{r}
data <- left_join(mri_pts, all_pts, by = c("last_name", "first_name"))
View(data)

# QC check: 2 participnts names were mispelled in one so the sub-num did not tranfer over

# add in data value
data[14, 3] <- "sub-65"
data[16, 3] <- "sub-77"

View(data)
```

```{r}
## Data Cleaning

# some are formatted like Sub-01 and some are sub-02
# all should be lowercase s

data$sub_num <- gsub("Sub", "sub", data$sub_num)
View(data)

# remove duplicated rows
alltracers <- alltracers %>% distinct()
nrow(alltracers)
View(alltracers)

# another way to remove duplicated rows 
#alltracers <- alltracers %>% 
 # group_by(sub_num) %>% 
  #group_by(year())
  #slice(1)
#nrow(alltracers)

alltracers <- alltracers[ ,c(1,2,16:20)]
View(alltracers)

# cols 16 - 20 has the cognitive composite data

```
## Final Join

```{r}
# join data and alltracers 
all <- left_join(data, alltracers, by = "sub_num")
View(all)
```
## Export
  
```{r}
write_xlsx(all, "/Volumes/shr1/Other Projects/working_files_SHB/for Mackenzie/aands_cog.xlsx")
