```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr) # for filter etc
library(magrittr)

#library(mice)
#library(naniar)
#library(UpSetR)

```

```{r}
# import completed dataset
completed_30306 <- read_excel("/Volumes/H-LAND/Statistics/Cognitive Imputation/output/completed_30306.xlsx")
```

For records-keeping purposes can you list the following:
1. number of subjects in final imputation set
2. number with missing values in each variable that were imputed
3. mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum of non-zero differences in correlations between measures before and after imputation
4. correlations of each cognitive composite with the other composites before and after imputation

For #3, take the values in the lower diagonal of the matrix, remove any = 0, and compute mean, sd, min and max.

```{r}
# 1
# number of subjects in final imputation set

nrow(completed_30306) 
# n = 141

```

```{r}
# 2
# number with missing values in each variable that were imputed
# so, sum the following cols: imp_story, imp_ln, imp_a, imp_b_a, imp_digit, imp_mmse, imp_sum

# define list of variable names
variable_names <- c("imp_story", "imp_ln", "imp_a", "imp_b_a", "imp_digit", "imp_mmse", "imp_sum")

#  lapply to apply sum to each variable
sums <- lapply(variable_names, function(var) sum(completed_30306[[var]]))

# print
print(sums)

# show sums as a table
# Convert the list of sums to a data frame or tibble
result_table <- data.frame(variable = variable_names, sum = unlist(sums))

# Print or view the resulting table
print(result_table)

```

```{r}
# 3. see note
# I use the cor_diff.. try running min(), max() etc 
```
